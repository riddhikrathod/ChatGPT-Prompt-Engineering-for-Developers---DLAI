    "\n",
    "What you will learn in this course:\n",

    "\n",
    "A language model is built using supervised learning (**x -> y** mapping training data) to repeatedly predict the next word.  It is then refined to follow instructions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the development of LLMs, there are mainly two types:  \n",
    "1. **Base LLMs** – Trained to predict the next word(s) on large-scale text training data  \n",
    "2. **Instruction-tuned LLMs** – Base LLMs fine-tuned with input-output pairs representing instructions, and further refined using **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) to be **HHH** (Helpful, Honest, and Harmless)  \n",

    "# Guidelines for Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll practice two prompting principles and their related tactics in order to write effective prompts for large language models.\n",
    "- **Principle 1**: Give clear and specific instructions (NOTE: a clear prompt is not the same as a short prompt)\n",
    "  - **Tactic 1**: Use delimiters\n",
    "  - **Tactic 2**: Ask for structured output\n",
    "  - **Tactic 3**: Ask model to check whether conditions/assumptions are met\n",
    "  - **Tactic 4**: Few-shot prompting\n",
    "- **Principle 2**: Give the model time to think\n",
    "  - **Tactic 1**: Specify steps to get to the output\n",
    "  - **Tactic 2**: Instruct the model to work out its own solution\n",
